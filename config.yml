              👋 Hi! I'm a security engineer with over seven years of experience in building and securing scalable cloud infrastructure. My focus is on shifting security left, integrating automated guardrails, and catching risks early in the development process. I bring technical skills in cloud security, IAM, Kubernetes, IaC, and Python, and I enjoy building tools that proactively mitigate threats. I’m also passionate about giving back to the security community — whether it's contributing to DEFCON or BSides, mentoring others, or supporting hands-on challenges that encourage innovative approaches in cybersecurity.
